### SML-lib C/C++ Style Guide

#### File Organization

- Use a clear, concise, and consistent naming convention for your source code files.
- Use appropriate header guards to prevent multiple inclusions of header files.
- Separate headers and implementation files.

```c
// Good example
#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H

// Header content

#endif // MY_HEADER_H
```

#### Code Formatting

- Use the provided `.clang-format` settings for code formatting.
- Use a consistent indentation style. The provided settings specify an indentation of 4 spaces.
- Keep code lines within a reasonable character limit (usually around 80-120 characters per line).

#### Comments

- Use comments to explain non-trivial sections of code, particularly if they are not self-explanatory.
- Add comments to clarify the purpose of functions, variables, and complex logic.
- Include comments at the top of each source file to describe its purpose and any relevant information.

```c
// This is an example of a file-level comment describing the contents and purpose of the file.
```

#### Code Structure

- Use a clear and consistent code structure. In the provided code, use consistent spacing and formatting.
- Group related functions and variables together.
- Use meaningful function and variable names. Ensure that their naming adheres to a consistent convention.

#### Error Handling

- Use appropriate error handling mechanisms, like returning error codes or exceptions.
- Provide clear and descriptive error messages when reporting errors.

```c
// Good example
if (error_condition) {
    return ERROR_GENERIC;
}

// Provide a descriptive error message when needed
sml_throw_error(cfg, ERROR_GENERIC, LOG_SEVERITY_ERROR, "An error occurred: %s", error_message);
```

#### Function and Variable Naming

- Use descriptive function and variable names to make the code self-documenting.
- Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase or snake_case) for functions and variables.

```c
// Good example
int calculateTotalPrice(int itemPrice, int quantity);
```

#### Macros

- Use macros with uppercase letters and underscores to represent constants.
- Provide comments explaining the purpose and usage of macros.

```c
// Good example
#define MAX_SML_NAME_LEN 256
```

#### Testing

- Include test functions to verify the correctness of your code.
- Organize test functions in a separate section or file.
- Document how to run tests and include example test cases.

```c
// Example test function
void test_error_lib(void) {
    // Test cases and assertions
}
```

#### Debug Mode

- Enable and disable debug mode through preprocessor directives, as shown in the provided code.
- Use debug mode for debugging and development, and ensure it doesn't affect the production code.

```c
#if (DEBUG == 1)
    // Debug-related code
#else
    // Production code
#endif
```

#### Version Control

- Use version control tools like Git to manage your codebase.
- Follow a clear and consistent commit message format to provide information about changes.

```plaintext
feat: Add new feature XYZ
fix: Fix issue with ABC
docs: Update documentation
```

#### Other Considerations

this is not strictly governed, but it helps code readability. Hope you have fun!
